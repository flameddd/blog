- Start responses with a summary of language, libraries, requirements, and plan.
- End with a history summary, source tree, and next task suggestions.
- Suggest solutions proactively and treat the user as an expert.

## Assistant Rules and General Code Guidelines Copilot Instructions

- Ask about stack assumptions if needed.
- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
- Understand requirements and stack holistically.

- Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities; preserve existing structures.
- Provide all edits in a single chunk per file, not in multiple steps.
- Don't ask the user to verify implementations visible in the provided context.
- Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
- Always provide links to real files, not context-generated files.
- Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

- Replace hardcoded values with named constants.
- Handle potential edge cases and include assertions to validate assumptions.
- Write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, secure, performant, and efficient code.

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase style for React component names.
- Use camelCase style for variable and function names.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Follow standard TypeScript and JavaScript naming conventions.
- Prefix event handler functions with "handle" (e.g., handleClick).
- Use constants instead of functions where possible; define types if applicable.

## HTML Requirements

- Use HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<search>`, etc.)
- Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Ensure valid markup that passes W3C validation
- Use responsive design practices
- Optimize images using modern formats (`WebP`, `AVIF`)
- Include `loading="lazy"` on images where applicable
- Generate `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images when relevant
- Prioritize SEO-friendly elements (`<title>`, `<meta description>`, Open Graph tags)
- Implement proper metadata for SEO.

## CSS, Styling Requirements

- Leverage Tailwind’s utility classes for most visual styles.  
- Ensure UI is responsive and accessible.
- Implement responsive, mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) and relative units (`rem`, `%`) for font sizes, spacing, and container widths.  
- Media queries for responsive design
- Use Flexbox for one-dimensional alignment (nav bars, button groups).  
- Use CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts (page sections, card galleries).  
- Combine both when needed: grid for overall skeleton, flex for internal alignment.
- Centralize color, spacing, and typography scales as CSS custom properties in `:root`
- Detect user preference with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and override variables
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- CSS animations and transitions
- Favor performant transforms (e.g. `translate`, `scale`, `opacity`) over layout-forcing properties.  
- Respect accessibility with a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, etc.)
- Modern selectors (`:is()`, `:where()`, `:has()`)
- Follow BEM or similar methodology for class naming
- Use CSS nesting where appropriate
- Include dark mode support with `prefers-color-scheme`
- Prioritize modern, performant fonts and variable fonts for smaller file sizes
- For perfect fluid typography, consider `clamp()`: `font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 1.5rem);`
- Keep utility classes (Tailwind) separate from BEM classes to maintain clarity.
- Follow BEM or a similar methodology for custom component classes:
  - Block: `.card`
  - Element: `.card__header`
  - Modifier: `.card--highlighted`
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA or AAA standards.  
- Define clear focus states (`outline-offset`, visible ring utilities in Tailwind).  
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.

## JavaScript Guidelines/Requirements

- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes.
- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces. Avoid enums, use maps.
- File structure: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise, one-line syntax for simple statements.
- Prefer `const` and `let`; avoid `var` entirely.  
- Use template literals for string interpolation:  
- Indent with 2 spaces and include a blank line between logical blocks.
- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) for better tree-shaking and clarity.  
- Default exports only when a module has a single responsibility; otherwise, prefer named exports.  
- Limit each variable’s scope to the smallest block necessary.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Use default and rest parameters rather than `arguments`.
- Prefer `async`/`await` over raw Promises
- Use `Promise.allSettled` or `Promise.race` for concurrent flows.  
- Always catch and propagate errors; never swallow without logging or user feedback.
- Debounce or throttle heavy event handlers (scroll, resize).  
- Cache computed results when used repeatedly.  
- Minimize layout thrashing: batch DOM reads before writes.  
- Clean up event listeners and timers to prevent memory leaks.
- Write unit tests with Jest, Mocha, or Vitest.  
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage and test edge cases.  
- Mock external services and isolate side effects.  
- Integrate tests into CI pipelines to catch regressions early.
- Never use `eval()` or dynamic code generation.  
- Sanitize all user inputs and escape HTML to prevent XSS.  
- Store secrets in environment variables, not code.  
- Use HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS) when serving web apps.
- Investigate the Performance API and `requestIdleCallback` for smoother UIs.  
- Validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully.

## TypeScript Guidelines/Requirements

- Use TypeScript for all code
  - prefer types over interfaces.
  - Avoid enums, use maps.
- Use TypeScript types for all components and functions.
- Always annotate function return types and public APIs.  
- Use generics for reusable components and functions.
- PascalCase naming style for types and interfaces (`UserProfile`, `FetchResult`).  
- Avoid `any` and Suppressions
- Audit every `// @ts-ignore` or `any` use.  
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when interoperability is unavoidable.  
- Replace with accurate types, `unknown`, or minimal assertions.  
- Document justifications when suppression is truly unavoidable.

## Coding Style

- Code must start with a path/filename one-line comment.
- Prioritize modularity, DRY, performance, and security.
- Use ES module syntax.
- Comments should describe purpose and effect when necessary.
- Suggest refactorings and code improvements where appropriate.
- Favor the latest ES and Node.js features.
- If code can't be finished, add TODO: comments.
- Use early returns to avoid nested conditions.

## ReactJS

- Use `function`, not `const`, for components.
- Optimize React rendering with memoization (e.g., React.memo).
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Lazy load components and images when possible.
- Make new UI components reusable and consistent with existing patterns.
- Reference existing components/pages for new work.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values; avoid try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage and return errors to the client.
- Use error boundaries (error.tsx, global-error.tsx) for unexpected errors.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ should throw user-friendly errors for tanStackQuery to catch and display.
- Use next-safe-action for all server actions:
  - Implement type-safe server actions with validation.
  - Use Zod for input schemas.
  - Handle errors gracefully and return ActionResponse type.
  - Use import type { ActionResponse } from '@/types/actions'.
  - Ensure all server actions return ActionResponse.
  - Implement consistent error and success responses.

## Performance Optimization

- Use efficient data structures and algorithms.

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize all user inputs thoroughly.
- Parameterize database queries.
- Enforce strong Content Security Policies (CSP).
- Use CSRF protection where applicable.
- Ensure secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`).
- Limit privileges and enforce role-based access control.
- Implement detailed internal logging and monitoring.

## Commit Messages

- Always suggest a conventional commit with type and optional scope in lowercase.
- Keep commit messages concise (≤60 characters) and ready to paste.
- Provide the full git commit command.
- Enable the /commit command to generate a conventional commit message.

## Documentation and Commenting Requirements

- Add comments where the operation isn't clear or uncommon libraries are used.
- Start code with a path/filename as a one-line comment.
- Comments should describe the purpose, not the effect.
- Document complex functions with clear examples.
- Use JSDoc comments for JavaScript and ES6 files.
- Do not use JSDoc comments in TypeScript files; rely on TypeScript's type system.
- Maintain concise Markdown documentation.

## JSDoc

- The JSDoc in this repo is important as it gets converted to markdown docs for the website, so it should read like documentation.
- Don't include `@params`, `@args`, `@template`, or `@returns` in our jsdoc

## Coding Process

- Show concise step-by-step reasoning.
- Prioritize and list tasks/steps in each response.
- Finish one file before starting the next.
- If code is incomplete, add TODO comments.
- Interrupt and ask to continue if needed.

## Editing Code

- Return the completely edited file.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Handle errors and edge cases at the start of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions; avoid deep nesting.
- Place the happy path last in the function.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern.
- Use guard clauses for preconditions and invalid states.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Use custom error types or factories for consistent error handling.
- If you encounter a bug or suboptimal code, add a TODO comment outlining the problem.
